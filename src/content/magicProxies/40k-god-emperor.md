An MtG proxy deck built around the Warhammer 40K universe. It's built around ecclesiastical part of the Imperium, so there are a lot of Living Saints (angels) and humans. The deck is supposed to be piloted with God Emperor of Mankind (a.k.a. Heliod, Sun-Crowned) so there are also various life gain synergies.
