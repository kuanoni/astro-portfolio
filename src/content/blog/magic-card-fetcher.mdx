Mono red is, undoubtedly, the least powerful color identity in EDH. Regardless (or perhaps, BECAUSE of this), I love it to death. The weird ways I'm forced to expand my brain to build around its MANY restrictions is a wonderful puzzle, but many people unprepared for what it forces you to do may stumble and come out the other end with a dismantled deck. I, for one, almost dismantled MY mono red [[Magda, the Hoardmaster]] (the thunder junction one, not the OP cEDH one) in favor of a Gruul ramp list, before I realized how to optimally upgrade it into something way more consistent. And now, I have a deck I'll always love way more than any Gruul creature pile.

This guide will not be custom fit to every single mono red deck, whereas my previous control deck guide on this sub was a little more all encompassing, since there's a lot of different strategies you might plan on using.

The biggest problem with mono red is card draw--or lack thereof. It's even worse than mono white, unless you're building [[Zada, Hedron Grinder]], which kind of builds itself, and has way fewer of these issues in general.

Many people will suggest impulse draw, or "discard one, draw two" effects. The latter isn't actually card draw, merely card filtering, as it costs 2 cards to grant you 2 different cards. The former is really tough to build around, because it forces you to have an incredibly tight mana curve, spells as high as 3 mana being a serious danger to include at risk of spending 2 mana to impulse draw, and being stuck with 3 untapped lands, having to cast only ONE of the two cards exiled, thereby once again going only NEUTRAL in card advantage. This creates a very possible spellslinger or small creature strategy, but the latter of those two strategies scales very poorly in EDH where you have 6 times the life totals to chip through.

The few commanders that make this restriction a lot easier tend to be overly commander reliant. [[Syr Carah, the Bold]] is capable of impulse drawing into 3 cards for every card that deals at least 1 damage to each of your opponents, making some truly explosive storm turns possible with enough rituals. And [[Ashling, Flame Dancer]] has the power to turn every unspent mana you have into what effectively serves as a treasure token for as long as she sticks on the field, not to mention the card filtering she gives to allow you to actually find cards that CAN go card positive, like previously mentioned card filtering cards paired with spell copy effects, which then cost 3 cards to go up by 4 minimum, or even colorless options like [[Minds Eye]], Ashling being one of the few commanders to make that card work nowadays since she can provide so much mana advantage. The most popular mono red commander, [[Krenko, Mob Boss]] isn’t only popular because it's wacky and explosive, but also because every token put on the field IS card advantage, giving more cards worth of value every single time you tap him. The big problem with this, however, is how bad red's creature protection is. The only mono red commander this DOESN’T really apply to is [[Chiss-Goria, Forge Tyrant]], since affinity for artifacts plus haste means you’ll probably get him out without having to pay any more, and he can just start doing his thing IMMEDIATELY, plus he’s already giving you built in card advantage. This guide is not for you Chiss-Goria players, you’re eating GOOD. But red certainly has spell redirection, but those are actively taking card space away from other types of vegetable cards that also don't add to your proactive game plan, while also having no answers to board wipes. Plus, if you impulse draw into these, they're effectively useless. I’ll go over protection in a bit after I talk about card advantage. 

Now, we're forced to stretch our definition of what card draw/card advantage even IS, and custom fit our card advantage pieces to our specific strategy.

my [[Magda, the Hoardmaster]] deck uses the following as card advantage engines: The most obvious are [[Idol of Oblivion]] [[Jeska's Will]], and [[Demand Answers]], but I also include [[Kuldotha Forgemaster]], [[Magda, Brazen Outlaw]], [[Apex of Power]], [[Aetherworks Marvel]], [[Brass's Tunnel-Grinder]], [[Nexus of Becoming]], and [[Portal to Phyrexia]]. Kuldotha Forgemaster turns treasures, something I’m already making, into a free card. Same with Magda Brazen Outlaw, and Aetherworks Marvel. [[Portal to Phyrexia]] effectively gives me one creature card every turn. Now, these DO force me to commit that card to the board, exposing me to board wipes, which is why I’ve been meaning to replace by [[Darksteel Colossus]] (terrible card smh) with a [[Darksteel Forge]] one day. But even without that, I still have [[Soul of New Phyrexia]]. 

And if you use your imagination even further, the following cards can help make up for the lack of card draw in other unique ways: [[Etali, Primal Storm]], [[Syr Ginger, the Meal Ender]] (card filtering into things that can give me more card advantage), [[Wandering Archaic]] etc. 

Other cards address the lack of card draw in other ways: repeatability. I replaced one of my creature removal spells with [[Transmogrifying Wand]], because although it's more mana and only at sorcery speed, it's also 3 removal spells for the price (or card slot) of 1, which also helps commit more crimes. It's also why I run [[Bladegriff Prototype]]. Every time I hit someone with Bladegriff Prototype, I’m effectively getting a card’s worth of removal, so imagine if a phyrexian arena just drew you into a removal spell every single turn.

It's also extra important for your cards to serve multiple purposes, so that with fewer cards in hand, you're still more likely to have what you need. For instance, my favorite card in the deck, [[Mirage Mirror]], not only commits crimes, but can also be literally any other card, which has saved me more than a few times from my toolbox artifact package with [[Magda, Brazen Outlaw]] and [[Kuldotha Forgemaster]]. One time someone put an [[Unable to Scream]] on my commander, so I tutored in the Mirage Mirror to legend rule my own commander and put it back in the zone. But for a more simple example, I recently replaced some of my crime committing artifacts. Most of these do literally nothing besides targeting something, which sucks considering a significant portion of deckspace has to be dedicated to them to get my engines running, and deck space is a valuable resource in a color that topdecks so often, plus once I have four crime committers at once, I don’t need any additional ones due to the “once each turn” clause of Magda’s ability. One of them turned target permanent into any color, and another let me pay X mana to make target player mill X, which ended up always being zero. Which was a funny joke, but not too helpful if Magda was dead. So instead, I added [[Goblin Motivator]] and [[Bloodlust Inciter]], because they served an additional function, even if it meant getting them swept up by board wipes. [[Edifice of Authority]] is another crime committer that has unexpectedly lifted some heavy weights for me, single handedly winning me countless games, despite arguably being a lower rate than other pillow fort effects unless you’re in a proliferate shell that cares a lot about combat. Because it does two things. I’ve also been enjoying [[Phyrexian Furnace]], [[Relic of Progenitus]], and [[Scrabbling Claws]]. Not only are these graveyard hate, but I can also sac them to dig further in my deck in a pinch, or when I already have crime committers equal to the number of players. Also, extra special shoutout to [[Wand of Denial]] for saving me from countless topdeck removal spells, and letting me dig through my OWN library when I need a land, even if it is just a crime committer most of the time. This is also why I think every single deck 1 and 2 color deck should run MDFC's if they can (unless you're doing like a basic lands matter theme/subtheme). Point is: if you lack card advantage, you might still get away with card compactness. The most compact cards in the entire format are tutors. So I run as many as I feasibly can, despite [[Gamble]] and [[Reckless Handling]] technically being card negative. That being said, since I have less cards in hand than normal, it forces me to play this interesting game of chances where I have to either get them out in the early game in exchange for not playing an early crime committer or Magda to minimize my chances of discarding the card I want, or waiting until I can draw enough cards to use it. It's these weird layers of strategy I love about the restrictions mono red forces me into. 

Now that I addressed red's biggest weakness, that being card advantage, let's talk about protection. Obviously there's redirection, and the many colorless artifact equipment that can give hexproof and/or indestructible, but those are usually sorcery speed and have the problem of not being very compact; they’re usually very clearly protective pieces and not much else. For my Magda deck, one thing that helps is the fact that she’s only 2 mana, and I can recast her, especially since she makes me treasures. If you’re doing a deck with a low mana commander, ramp CAN be protection. Otherwise, I would recommend making a less commander reliant gameplan, unless you’re Ashling Flame Dancer, at which point you can either use the number of copy instant/sorcery spells you’d be running to threaten to remove opponents things as a mutually assured destruction tactic, or just dig through your deck as fast as you can for redirection spells, assuming you’ve saved up enough mana. It's also one of the better homes for [[Tibalt’s Trickery]], which is probably the most compact protection spell red has. Then there's the previously mentioned [[Soul of New Phyrexia]] if you make enough mana, and [[Darksteel Forge]] if you do artifact stuff, which has the compactness of helping out in combat just as much as it does against board wipes. Remember, indestructible isn’t what it used to be against creatures, but very few people have reliable ways to exile artifacts from the field. Another thing
I’ve noticed is how haste can sorta be protection? Not that it's good protection, but it lets your creatures do things before people untap, so you can sandbag your haste creatures more comfortably.
But before I move on, I'd suggest adding an "out" for your commander, even if you need its effect. For example, multiple cards in my Magda deck were added with the express purpose of making me no longer REQUIRE her ramp services, so oftentimes I'll use my tutors and Kuldotha Forgemaster type cards to get something like a [[Nexus of Becoming]] on the field. I reccomend all of you do something similar--add a potential out in your 99, and a way to consistently search for it. Now, again, it's always good to make a non-commander reliant deck, but this is harder to do in red because one of the few ways to make playing exclusively the worst color actually good is by making up for it with a busted commander. Especially since you're not garunteed to draw into all of your busted cards, because drawing is not a thing you'll often do. This is another reason why compactness is extra, extra important.

By the way, despite red being a very inconsistent color by itself, it's also very explosive when things DO go your way. So you can really start winning out of nowhere with insane value, when just a turn ago you were durdling around and no one bothered attacking you. Its one of its few strengths (by itself. I cannot stress enough how much better red gets when you pair it with blue, or any other color for that matter).

Now, obviously not every mono red deck can run Aetherworks Marvel as their card advantage engine, so let me break down your options by what I consider to be the most common mono red archetypes, just off the top of my head. There’s definitely more stuff than what I offer, but you’d have to look really hard. Like, Aetherworks Marvel didn’t jump into my head when I first thought of “treasure deck card advantage,” so there’s definitely stuff out there. 

Treasures. I already went over a lot of different (and more niche) options going over my Magda Deck, but I’d also like to throw in a few I excluded. [[Professional Face Breaker]] is obviously good if your mana curve is low enough, but if you intend on playing gigantic high mana threats with those treasures, it’s probably going to remain a treasure generator, and shouldn’t be categorized as reliable draw. But [[Academy Manufactor]] on the other hand makes you clues, and clues turn into cards. But everyone knows those two. Also [[Trading Post]].

Spellslinger/Burn: This one has the most straightforward suite of card draw. Just throw in cantrips, the many discard one, draw two effects, and [[Dragon’s Rage Channeler]] for card filtering, then pack it with a healthy amount of impulse draw, keeping in mind how important it is to keep your mana curve low unless you’re running a commander that can make a disgusting amount of mana–just remember if you do that, you’re making the deck more commander reliant, and impulse draw doesn’t work well with redirection spells. There’s also a lot of spell copy effects that can be very effective. We also can't ignore wheel effects; I hate them in blue unless you're doing a forced draw strategy, but in red, I'd take anything you can get.

Voltron: my biggest advice with mono red voltron is–unless you’re doing [[Slicer, Hired Muscle]] or [[Alexios, Deimos of Kosmos]] probably don’t do it in the first place? It’s an inconsistent strategy in inconsistent colors, and would be much better served with the addition of other colors. But if you insist (or if you’re doing Slicer or Alexios), off the top of my head I can think of [[The Aetherspark]] and multiple of the Swords of Blank and Blank. There’s also [[Tome of Legends]]. Voltron’s not really my cup of tea, so I apologise if I can’t think of very many good options for this one. At the very least, your goal is to take someone out before you end up having to topdeck in the first place. 

Traditional Aggro: If you swing with a bunch of dudes, [[Mask of Memory]], [[Rose, Cutthroat Raider]], [[ED-E, Lonesome Eyebot]], Professional Facebreaker (again) and maybe even [[Grenzo, Havoc Raiser]] are all good picks here. Maybe [[Subira, Tulzidi Caravaneer]] if you’re doing low power matters or make a bunch of little tokens, like in a goblin deck. Note that a lot of these can also apply to goad strategies since most creatures don’t have vigilance so you can get in for damage and use that as your draw package. 

Artifacts: First of all Chiss Goria, Forge Tyrant is crazy. Run it. But believe it or not [[Chaos Wand]] is card advantage? Its a stretch, I know, but it exists lmao. There’s also the aforementioned [[Kuldotha Forgemaster]] and maybe even [[Tamiyo’s Journal]] if you make any clues? Those ones are pretty bad admittedly (at least when it comes to card ADVANTAGE over card selection), but alternatively, there’s multiple artifact recursion cards like [[Scrap Trawler]] and [[Salvaging Station]], or for bigger mana artifacts, either Daretti: [[Daretti, Rocketeer Engineer]] (who’s probably underrated), or [[Daretti, Scrap Savant]]. These cards are effectively drawing card advantage from your graveyard. From there you can sacrifice something like a [[Hylda’s Crown of Winter]] or other smaller artifacts that can be sacrificed to draw cards like [[Mishra’s Bauble]] or [[Urza’s Bauble]] and bring them back to do it all over again. And if you’re reanimating artifacts, discarding is no longer losing card advantage, nor is milling with something like [[Palantir of Orthanc]]. This thought process also applies to [[Feldon of The Third Path]], but with creatures instead of artifacts. Speaking of Feldon…

Cheating with Big Mana Guys. These are your Feldons, your [[Purphoros, Bronze-Blooded]]s, your [[Tannuk, Steadfast Second]]s, your [[Heirgast, Erupting Nullkite]]s, and your [[Ilharg, the Raze-Boar]]s. Cheating in big mana stuff is a good start considering you generally get more value per card, but it doesn’t solve the issue entirely. [[Dragon Mage]] is one I pretty quickly found on EDHrec, right above Etali, so I don’t think this archetype of deck is struggling in that regard. Still, these decks seem very commander reliant, so I would put in a [[Nexus of Becoming]] just to play it safe, in addition to the card draw it provides. 

Temporary Clones: This is stuff like [[Jaxis, the Troublemaker]], [[Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker]], [[Rionya, Fire Dancer]], [[Delina, Wild Mage]], [[Orthion, Hero of Lavabrink]], or [[Calamity, Galloping Inferno]]. There’s a lot of cards that you could find that draw a card when they leave the battlefield like [[Solemn Simulacrum]], but I’d also like to draw your attention to [[Humble Defector]], as well as tutors on a stick like [[Imperial Recruiter]] and [[Hoarding Dragon]], which technically draws you any 1 card of your choice. This is probably one of the easier strategies to address the card advantage issue, admittedly, since you’re getting consistent value every turn from each of your clones. 

Goad/Pillow Fort. This is specifically for [[Fumiko the Lowblood]] and [[Kazuul, Tyrant of the Cliffs]]. Since you’re gonna be left alone for longer, you have more time to ramp, so [[Minds Eye]] starts looking a lot better. And if there’s forced combat happening, [[Hylda’s Crown of Winter]] draws a LOT more cards. 

Not so much a deck archetype in red (it becomes an archetype usually when black is thrown into the mix), but a common thread in a lot of red decks: discard. If you have a lot of effects that discard a card to draw a card, consider cards like [[Containment Construct]] and [[Bag of Holding]] to turn those discards back into card advantage, or even madness cards. Also don’t forget [[Squee, Goblin Nabob]], which can be repeatedly discarded for looting effects every turn, effectively giving you a free card every turn. This discard strategy has a lot of overlap with Spellslinger/Burn, but can be found in any of these. You may even want to make this a subtheme. Ironically, discard might be a good way to get more cards. This is especially good with Jaxis the Troublemaker and Ashling, Flame Dancer, which in my opinion are some of the better mono red commanders. 

Also, general rule of thumb, if you make 1/1’s, run Skullclamp, regardless of what kind of deck it is or what colors it is. Unless it's out of your budget. 

Also, if you’re really desperate, [[Endless Atlas]] and [[War Room]] exist, but they’re not very fast nor efficient. There’s also [[Spinerock Knoll]] which is kinda cantrip-esque in a way.

Also, the more card filtering you have, the more likely you’ll be able to find your card advantage engines when you need them. 

But remember, these picks won’t include stuff I haven’t thought of that act as card advantage without technically serving as card draw. I leave finding those up to you, so good luck on scryfall out there everyone. 

TL:DR, card advantage is hard to come by, so you have to focus more on card filtering, and adjust your scryfall searches to not limit yourself to anything that says “draw,” because there’s things that are card advantage that aren’t technically draw. Also you need to prioritize cards that can do multiple things at once over ones that do one thing a bit better. Also impulse draw NEEDS a low mana curve, and don’t make your deck too commander reliant unless you can repeatedly recast them or have COMPACT methods of protecting it. 

Btw, here's my Magda decklist for anyone curious. https://moxfield.com/decks/fZlvjC0M40SYpsaGdz9XHA 

And if you have any ideas for something to replace a few inconsistent stinkers like [[Darksteel Colossus]] (I don't wanna buy a Blightsteel nor a Darksteel Forge at the current moment; maybe later) let me know. I'd also be interested if anyone would like to recommend large creatures and/or artifacts with built in noncreature removal. 

Happy brewing everyone!
