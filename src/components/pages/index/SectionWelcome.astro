				This my personal site. I use it to showcase my <a href='/projects'>portfolio work</a> and other <a
					href='/random.html'>random</a
				> things I've created.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've always been in love with programming and at the moment my focus lies in web development. I've
				worked with both front-end and backend technologies (although mostly front-end) and I'm constantly
				looking to improve and expand my skills.
